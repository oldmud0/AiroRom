Hi web-tourist!

This is the **AiroRom** wiki where you will find all non-code data of my project.

# What is AiroRom?
AiroRom is my _undergraduate thesis_ (_dissertation_ / _final degree work_) of the **Degree in Electrical Engineering** at the _Universidad de Granada_ (Spain). The purpose of this work is to study different data protection mechanisms implemented in video-games. I will figure out the complexity, quality and performance of each algorithm as well as to document them.
